# 74LVC125APW consists of four non-inverting buffers/line drivers with 3-state outputs 
(nY) that are controlled by the output enable input (nOE
). A HIGH at nOE
 causes the 
outputs to assume a high-impedance OFF-state.
Inputs can be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V de
vices. When disabled, up to 5.5 V can be 
applied to the outputs.
